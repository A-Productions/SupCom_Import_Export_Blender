SupCom_Import_Export_Blender
============================

Python scripts to import and export Supreme Commander units and animations to Blender.


Place the .py scripts in BlenderInstallDir/v.num/scripts/addons

They'll appear in import/export category in Blender.

Tested on Blender 2.71

Kmown issue : 
Bones doesn't have the correct orientation once exported.


Credits to dan & Brent for the previous version. My unique work was to port the addons from blender 2.49 to blender 2.71
